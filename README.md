## Hi there 👋


# When Volatility Rises, I Don’t React — I Execute.

## Who I Am
A strategist operating at the intersection of risk, language, and machine logic.  
With over 15 years of real-market trading experience and a growing portfolio of AI/NLP projects, I build systems that interpret volatility, structure output, and translate uncertainty into action.

## What I Do
- Design and execute alpha strategies (see: VIX Regime Model)
- Conduct bilingual tone analysis for AI/NLP tasks
- Build and assess prompt frameworks for multilingual LLMs
- Integrate quantitative finance logic into cross-functional outputs

## Key Capabilities
- 15+ years experience in equities, futures, and US markets
- Practical Alpha strategy execution (VIX-based model live)
- CQF in progress | Python, Prompt Design, Data Structuring
- Fluent in Mandarin, Functional in English, Learning Japanese
- Tone-based narrative control, suitable for cross-system roles

## What I'm Looking For
Remote roles that value clarity, modular output, and cross-disciplinary thinking.  
I specialize in risk-focused logic structuring, multilingual tone alignment, and LLM task execution. Especially suitable for hybrid AI/Finance/Research teams.
